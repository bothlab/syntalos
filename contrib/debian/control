Description: Synchronized parallel DAQ from diverse sources
 Syntalos is a software for timestamp-synchronized parallel data acquisition
 from diverse data sources.
 It is especially useful for in-vivo behavior tracking, electrophysiology,
 miniscope recordings and control of automated closed-loop experiments in
 neuroscience. Its modularity allows it to be used for a wide variety of
 different experiment types.
 .
 The project contains many modules by default which allow acquisition of
 data from a wide array of data sources, as well as common online processing
 tasks. Some modules may require 3rd-party components to work properly.
