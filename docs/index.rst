Syntalos is a software for timestamp-synchronized parallel data acquisition from diverse data sources,
such as cameras, microendoscopes, Intan electrophysiology amplifiers or Firmata-based serial interfaces.
The software also allows user-defined closed-loop interventions via its built-in Python scripting support.
It is specifically designed for use in (neuro)scientific in vivo behavior experiments.

These pages document the software, for users who just want to use Syntalos, as well as developers who want
to make more advanced changes.
