Python Script
#############

The "Python Script" module provides Syntalos' Python scripting interface.
It allows users to write custom Python code to control experiment behavior.


Usage
=====

You can enter custom Python script in the modules' *Settings* window and add/remove input
and output ports using the port editor (reachable via *Ports â†’ Edit* in the script main window):

.. figure:: /graphics/pyscript-ports-dialog.avif
  :width: 340

  The ports configuration dialog

There are tutorials available that explain how to use this module:

* :doc:`/tutorials/03_script-control`
* :doc:`/tutorials/04_firmata-interface`


Ports
=====

* Ports are fully customizable using the port editor.


Stream Metadata
===============

* Stream metadata is fully customizable by scripting.


Example Script
==============

This is an example script that just demonstrates how to obtain video data from
an input port, and just forwards the data to its output port without editing it:

.. code-block:: python

    import syio as sy
    from syio import InputWaitResult


    # Get references to your ports by their ID here.
    # Examples:
    iport = sy.get_input_port('video-in')
    oport = sy.get_output_port('video-out')


    def prepare():
        """
        This function is called before a run is started.
        You can use it for (slow) initializations.
        NOTE: You are *not* able to send output to ports here, or access
        any valid master timer time. This function can be slow.
        """

        # Set appropriate metadata on output ports
        oport.set_metadata_value('framerate', 200)
        oport.set_metadata_value_size('size', [800, 600])


    def start():
        """
        This function is called immediately when a run is started.
        Access to the timer is available, and data can be sent via ports.
        You can *not* change any port metadata anymore from this point onward.
        This function should be fast, many modules are already running at this point.
        """
        pass


    def loop() -> bool:
        """
        This function is executed by Syntalos continuously until it returns False.
        Use this function to retrieve input and process it, or run any other
        repeatable action. Keep in mind that you will not receive any new input
        unless `sy.await_new_input()` is called.
        """

        # wait for new input to arrive
        wait_result = sy.await_new_input()
        if wait_result == InputWaitResult.CANCELLED:
            # the run has been cancelled (by the user or an error),
            # so this function will not be called again
            return False

        # retrieve data from our ports until we run out of data to process
        while True:
            frame = iport.next()
            if frame is None:
                # no more data, exit
                break

            # TODO: do something with the data here!

            # submit data to an output port
            oport.submit(frame)

        # return True, so the loop function is called again when new data is available
        return True


    def stop():
        """
        This function is called once a run is stopped, by the user, and error or when
        the loop() function returned False.
        """
        pass
