/**
 * @brief Manages a thread which is running evented modules
 *
 * This class can be created in one thread and opaquely manages a second
 * thread which is running a dedicated event loop to execute the tasks
 * by the registered modules at their desired interfvals.
 *
 * Running module tasks at particular intervals or have them possibly wait
 * on other events it is tricky using the standard QEventLoop, since
 * Syntalos does not use QThread in many occasions and tries to never move
 * objects between threads explicitly, ruling out the use of the Qt event system.
 *
 * Therefore, the thread managed by this class runs a GMainLoop-based event
 * loop to have much tighter control on what is executed when and why, and
 * to take care of Syntalos-specific quirks.
