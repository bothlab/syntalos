This module is based on the original Intan RHX code from
https://github.com/Intan-Technologies/Intan-RHX

The last commit used for the derived version is mentioned below.
It is recommended to regularly merge in upstream patches that affect
Syntalos as well.
When merging, please not that the "semaphore.h" header was renamed to "rhx-semaphore.h"
to avoid conflicts with the POSIX header of the same name that Syntalos relies on.
