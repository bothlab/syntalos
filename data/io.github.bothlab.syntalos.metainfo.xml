    <p>
      Syntalos is a software for timestamp-synchronized parallel data acquisition from diverse data sources.
      It is especially useful for in-vivo behavior tracking, electrophysiology, Miniscope recordings and control
      of automated closed-loop experiments in neuroscience. Its modularity allows it to be used for a wide variety
      of different experiment types.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project contains many modules by default which allow acquisition of data from a wide array of data sources,
      as well as common online processing tasks. Some modules may require 3rd-party components to work properly.
